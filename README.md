## Repo for Coursera Data Scientist Specialisation Assignment 
## 'Getting and Cleaning Data'

# Repo content
This reopsitory contains the following files
* README.md (this doc)
* CodeBook.md (guide to study design, variable names, and data transformation steps)
* run_Analysis.R (the script to perform the data transformation steps as explained in 'CodeBook.md')
* myTidyData1.txt (a data frame of ~10MB, 10299 observations, and  88 variables)
* myTidyData2.txt (a data frame of ~1,8MB, 180 observations, and  563 variables)

# External content / Procedure
To perform the data transformation run_Analysis.R is programmed for unzip the source ( https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip ) into a folder on your local drive.
After downloading and unzipping DO NOT CHANGE the file structure of the folder 'UCI HAR Dataset' to make sure the script run_Analysis.R performs properly!

For further information on how run_Analysis makes the files from this folder work together, please see 'CodeBook.md'
